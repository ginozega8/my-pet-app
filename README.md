This is my first Full-Stack project. I made it to get more familiar to the new tools that I learned how to use. This project is basically a Wikipedia, the data comes from my MongoDB and it's conected with mongoose. I also used EJS for the creation of the header, footer, navbar and card template. The app also alows you to post your pet on the DB and a searchbar with simple filters.
